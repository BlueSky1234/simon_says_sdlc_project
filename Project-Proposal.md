### 1. **App Idea**
Our game is a reskin of Simon Says that will use words and symbols instead of colors, with symbols randomly alternating between rounds.

### 2. **Target Audience**
This game is designed to appeal to ages 9 and up who enjoy memorization and motor skill games.

### 3. **Goals and Vision**
The client wants the game to be engaging and fun, have a focus on motor skills, and to have the right amount of difficulty. 

### 4. **Key Features**
- **Memory Items**: The game will use symbols and words to add a fun challenge.
- **Puzzle Mechanics**: Items will change position every three rounds (only after the game), so players are "forced" to keep their eyes on the screen, focusing on where to press and how quickly to respond.
- **Reward System**: Points are awarded for correct inputs and deducted for incorrect ones.
- **Progress Tracking**: High scores will be saved and displayed, allowing players to see their personal records (PR) and strive to beat them.
- **Difficulty Options**: Players can choose whether the game speed increases over time or remains steady.


5. **Success Criteria**
To add a new layer of difficulty (with position-changing answers) that will appeal to older kids while maintaing attraction and quality. 

6. **Technical Requirements**
- **Platforms**: The game will be compatible with both mobile and PC, running smoothly at an fps level as low as 30.
- **Mobile Requirements**: Players will only need to use their fingers to interact with on-screen buttons.
- **PC Requirements**: Players will need a mouse (and potentially wasd/arrow keys) to click the correct sequence of buttons displayed on-screen.
