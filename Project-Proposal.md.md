# Project Proposal: Simon Says(Memory Game)

Team Members: Fayes-braincell, BlueSky1234
Client: Our Team
Date: 11/14/2024



1. **App Idea**
    Our game is a reskin of Simon Says that will use words and symbols instead of colors and the symbols will randomly alternate between rounds.

2. **Target Audience**
    This game is designed to appeal to ages 9 and up who enjoy memorization and motor skill games.

3. **Goals and Vision**
    The client wants the game to be Engaging and fun, have a focus on motor skills, and to have the right amount of difficulty. 

4. **Key Features**
	-	Items for memory will be symbols and words so that the game is a bit of a fun challenge..
	-	Puzzle mechanics: The items will change position every three rounds (only after the game)  so that the player isn't given the opportunity to take their eyes off the game, “forced” to focus on where they are to press, and how fast they need to click the requested item to move on.
	-	Reward based/Point collecting system: Points are collected with each correct input and are taken off with incorrect inputs
	-	Progress tracking: Highest scores are collected meaning if the player PRs (beats their past score), the high score changes and is displayed during the game.
    Difficulty options: The player can choose if they want their game to quicken as they progress or if they want it to be of more steady game play.

5. **Success Criteria**
    Successfully adding a new layer of difficulty to the game(the position changing answers) that will appeal to older kids without losing attraction or quality. 

6. **Technical Requirements**

    - The game will be made to run on Mobile and PC and be functionable at an fps level as low as 30. 
    - On mobile the only needed requirements will be your own fingers to press the right buttons.

    - On pc, the only required item would be a mouse to click on the buttons that appear on the screen in the correct order.
